        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>
          As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size.
          Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can
          imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
          delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart.
          Seeing this has to change a man.
